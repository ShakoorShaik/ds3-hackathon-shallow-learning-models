# Welcome to my ML Models for the DS3 Datathon 2025!

Welcome to the Shallow Learning DS3 Datathon 2025 GitHub repository for the Car Evaluation, Classifying Accidents, and Fungi Classification datasets.
## Files

- `car_eval_train.csv` - Training data
- `car_eval_test.csv` - Testing data
- `car_eval_submission.csv` - Sample submission.

- `Classifying_accidents-train.csv` - This is the training set used to train your model.
- `Classifying_accidents - test.csv` - This is the test set upon which you would make predictions.
- `SampleSubmission.csv` - This is a sample submission.

- `fungi_train.csv` - This file contains the ClassId and the path of the images located in the train folder.
- `fungi_test.csv` - This file contains the id and the path of the images located in the test folder.
- `fungi_sample_submission.csv` - This file outlines the required format for submission.
